# Goalie-Pygame
Programmed on Python: Youâ€™re the goalie, and you have to try to save all the pucks from going past the net. Balls will spawn on the screen regularly(every 5 seconds). You have to move the paddle around the screen so that the balls bounce off the paddle. If a ball flies off the screen, one point is added to the score.
